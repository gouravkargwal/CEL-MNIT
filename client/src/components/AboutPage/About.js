            Everyone does not have the same view of the world, and their
            understanding of something may differ dramatically from yours.
            Sometimes you can even create something awesome in your career by
            asking their thoughts or inputs on something you might not even know
            or have heard of. CeL will give you chance to grow, to be open to
            new ideas, new ways of doing things, or new ways of thinking.
